# Challenge 3
## Server with Express

### Instructions

1) Make a server project based on node.js that uses the express module and implements the following endpoints on port 8080:
- Route get **'/products'** that returns an array with all the products available on the server
- Route get **'/productoRandom'** that returns a product chosen at random among all the available products
  
Include a text file 'products.txt' and use the Wrapper class from the previous challenge to access the persisted data from the server.

Before starting the server, put in the 'products.txt' file three products as in the example of the previous challenge.
