# Challenge 11

## Mocks and Normalization

### Instructions

#### Mockups

**Setpoint:**
Regarding the deliverable challenge of class 8, create a view in the form of a table that consumes from the route '/api/products-test' of the server a list with 5 randomly generated products using Faker.js as a generator of random test information (instead of being taken from the database). Properly choose the themes to make up the 'product' object (name, price and photo).

#### Normalization

Given the object in JSON format *holding.json* that represents the information corresponding to a group of companies:

1) Define the normalization scheme.
2) Obtain the normalized object and print it on the console.
3) Denormalize the object obtained in the previous point.
4) Print the length of the original, normalized and denormalized object
5) Print the compression percentage of the normalization process.

Compare and analyze the results.
