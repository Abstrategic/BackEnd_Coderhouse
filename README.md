# Challenge 19

## Layer our project

### Instructions

- Divide the deliverable project with which we have been working into layers (class deliverable 16: loggers and profilers),
    appropriately grouping the route, controller, business logic and persistence layers.

- Consider grouping routes by functionality, with their controllers, business logic with use cases, and layer
    of persistence.

- The persistence layer will contain the necessary methods to deal with the interaction of the business logic with the
    own data.
